[2010 Ramadan Calendar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ohlpvhy3to7B1Toc_LkdyeuFCf8jBzoz)

As-salaamu ‘alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh,

This is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramadaan will be on Wednesday, August 11th. That means that we will be praying salaatut-taraweeh the night of Tuesday, August 10th.

The iqaamah for salaatul-‘ishaa will be 5 minutes after the adhaan immediately followed by salaatut-taraweeh at Musalla As-Sahaba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey). The iqaamah time will remain so unless further advised. Due to limited space, ‘ishaa and taraweeh prayers will be for brothers only.

Please see attached for the Ramadaan Calendar.

Barakallahu feekum.

HJC – 1st day of Ramadhaan 1431 – Wednesday 11 August 2010…

Official Decision and Announcement of the High Judiciary Council of Saudi Arabia…

Just a short time ago, Fatwa-Online was informed of the official decision and announcement of the High Judiciary Council of Saudi Arabia that since the moon of Ramadhaan was sighted this evening, here in Saudi Arabia, we have completed twenty nine (29) days of Sha’baan (1431 A.H.), in accordance with the hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam):

((Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Sha’baan. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days)), [transmitted by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].

Subsequently, we shall be starting our taraaweeh prayers tonight (Tuesday 10 August 2010) after the ‘Ishaa. prayer, in preparation for the first fast of Ramadhaan on Wednesday 11 August 2010, inshaa.-Allaah.
