From early 2016, a group of local brothers came together, recognizing a compelling need to have a Masjid in the Apopka area. Through Allāh’s help and guidance, we were able to identify a property in the Apopka area to use as a Masjid. The property where the Masjid is currently located was selected due to its central location and the potential for future growth. By Allāh’s mercy, MCCA was able to purchase the property through a Qard al-Ḥasan loan and we are in the process of repaying that loan. The building then underwent a rapid transformation to convert from a single family home into a Muṣallá capable of meeting the immediate and near future needs of the Apopka Muslim community. Alḥamdulillāh, through Allāh’s mercy and the effort of many volunteers, we opened our doors for Jummah on the 30th of Shaʿbān 1438 (May 26, 2017).",paragraphTwo:"In order to align with our goal of accommodating the needs of Muslim families in the Apopka area and the Apopka community at large, we are currently offering the following services:",services:[{title:"Five Daily Ṣalawāt",body:"The muṣallá is open to allow Muslims (both brothers and sisters) a location to pray their five daily ṣalawāt."},{title:"Ṣalat al-Jumʿuah",body:"Every week, salat-ul-Jumʿuah is held at Muslim Community Center of Apopka (due to limited space, for brothers only), where the khaṭīb deliver the khuṭbah strictly adhering to the Qur’ān & the Sunnah."},{title:"Ṣalat al-Tarawīḥ",body:"During the month of Ramaḍān, every evening Ṣalat al-Tarawīḥ is held."},{title:"Ṣalat al-ʿĪd",body:"For both ʿĪd al-Fiṭr and ʿĪd al-Aḍḥá, Muslim Community Center of Apopka holds ʿĪd prayers for the community along with family activities."},{title:"Community Engagement",body:"A few knowledgeable brothers remind us of the importance of various facets of our dīn in weekly gatherings.
